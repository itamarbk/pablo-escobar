                After a long hard day's work pablo wants to go out and have the night of his life, the only problem is that he's used up his whole stash. Lucky for him he has buried stashes of money throughout Columbia and he even has a map. you'll see it for as long as you want and when your ready you have to go out to look for it. Just remember to stay clear of the cops. They aren't the biggest fans of Pablo. Help the boss!
